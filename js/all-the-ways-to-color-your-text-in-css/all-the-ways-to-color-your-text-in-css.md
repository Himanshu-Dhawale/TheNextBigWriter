Color property in css is a very common property. It is used whenever there is a need to provide different color to Text. There are many ways to provide values to this property. Let's have a look into all those ways.

#### Hexadecimal Values

The word **hexadecimal** refers to a numerical value that uses 16 as a base instead of 10. A hexadecimal value can have 16 values for each digit in a number:

> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

A hexadecimal color code is a combination of [[Red]], [[Green]], [[Blue]] & [[Alpha]] (optional) values. The most common format of the hex code is a 3 or 6 digit color code prefixed with **#**, which is followed by color codes for Red, Green and Blue [[#RRGGBB]]. The code for each of the color is a 2 digit hexadecimal number between [[0-9]] and ([[a-f or A-F]]).

For example, these all are valid hexadecimal values:

> 00, 0A, 1D, 9D, F5, 99, E4, CC

The 2 digit hexadecimal number for each color is combined to create a 6 digit color value. If both the digit for each color code is same, then the 6 digit color code can be written as a 3 digit color code.

```css
// valid color codes

#000000 or #000
#FFFFFF or #FFF or #fff or #ffffff
#FF0000 or #ff0000
#2962ff
```

ðŸ“Œ **#RRGGBBAA**

We can also change the transparency of a color with the hexadecimal value, just by adding the optional alpha value code [[AA]] in [[#RRGGBB]] to make it [[#RRGGBBAA]].
The AA value in #RRGGBBAA can range from the lowest value possible (00) to the highest value possible (FF). The lowest will make the color fully transparent, which means you wonâ€™t see it anymore. The highest value will make it completely opaque, which is the default for hex codes anyway.

```css
// color value with no alpha or fully opaque
h1 {
    color: #FF0000;
}
```

> <h3 style="color: #ff0000">I am completely opaque<h1>

```css
// semi-transparent color
h1 {
    color: #FF000080;
}
```

> <h3 style="color: #FF000080">I am semi-transparent<h1>

ðŸ“Œ **Browser Compatibility**

The browser support for #RRGGBBAA hex codes is great. IE doesnâ€™t support it but otherwise you should be covered. Check [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-rrggbbaa) for details if youâ€™re curious.
