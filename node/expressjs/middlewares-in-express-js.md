## Middlewares in Express JS

It's been a long time that NODE JS has become a part of JS Ecosystem. Any JS developer Front End or Full Stack would be familiar with Node JS. Any one who has worked on Node would have also worked with Express JS.

So, Express JS is nothing but a framework to help organize your web application into an MVC architecture on the server side. It basically helps you manage everything from routes to handling requests and views for your web application.

### What are Middlewares

A middleware is just a function which takes request(req), response(res) and the next middleware function(next) as the arguments. These are the function which helps to intercept the incoming request, perform a specific task and pass the execution to next middleware or route handler or even they can end the request-response cycle by returning a response.

### How Middleware Works

Any request on the Node Server will be accessed by all the middlewares in the request-response cycle in a sequential order. The line of order in which the middlewares are defined matters a lot.You can take it as that the Output of first middleware is Input of the second middleware for request and response object. A middleware take a 3rd argument which is the next middleware or the route function. If your middleware doesn't returns a response it should call next() to pass the control to the next middleware function otherwise the request will always be hanging in the application.

### Types of Middlewares

There are many types of middlewares which are as follows:

###### Application Level Middleware

Any middleware which is bound with the express app using app.use() or app.METHOD( where METHOD can be any HTTP method - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). This type of middlewares are generally used to perform common business logics such as user authentication, logging each request etc.

###### Router Level Middleware

A middleware which is bound to an instance of express.Router(). It works similar to the application level middleware. Generally, it comes in use if you want to divide your main application routes to separate modules and use middlewares.

###### Built In Middleware

Express JS itself provides multiple built-In middlewares such as express.json, express.static etc. These can be used based on the use case in the application. Such as a web app will need express.static to server all the static resources for the web-app.

The entire list of built-in can be found here: <https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#middleware>

###### Error Handling Middleware

Express comes with a built-in error handler that takes care of any errors that might be encountered in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware function stack.

If you pass an error to next() and you do not handle it in a custom error handler, it will be handled by the built-in error handler; the error will be written to the client with the stack trace. The stack trace is not included in the production environment.

One can write any number of custom error handling middlewares in an app. The custom middlewares are different with other middlewares in a way that it accepts 4 arguments and the first one being the err.

###### Third Party Middlewares

There are multiple third party middlewares which can be used in Express. These can be used based on the use case in the application. Such as to parse the request body, your application needs a body parser.

Thatâ€™s all for now. I have tried to share my knowledge of Express Middlewares, hoping to help others. Please comment your valuable suggestions and feedback.
